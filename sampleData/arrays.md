# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).
17. [[Which country is known as the Land of Fire and Ice?:::Iceland.]]
18. [[What is the longest river in Europe?:::The longest river is the Volga River.]]
19. [[Which country is famous for its tulips and windmills?:::

The Netherlands.]]
20. [[What is the capital of Argentina?:::

The capital is Buenos Aires.]]

21. [[Which country is known as the Land of a Thousand Lakes? ::: Finland.]]
22. [[What is the largest lake in Africa?

::: The largest lake is Lake Victoria.]]
23. [[Which country is located in both Europe and Asia?

:::

Russia.]]
## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData;

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has actually been created yet]].
24. [[What is the official language of Japan?:::The official language is Japanese.]]
25. [[Which country is the driest inhabited continent on Earth?:::Australia.]]
26. [[What is the largest coral reef system in the world?:::The largest coral reef system is the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.]]
27. [[Which country is known as the Land of the Midnight Sun?:::Norway.]]
28. [[What is the largest lake in North America? ::: The largest lake is Lake Superior.]]
29. [[Which country is famous for its fjords? ::: Norway.]]
30. [[What is the capital of Mexico? ::: The capital is Mexico City.]]


## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];

- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable once instantiated.]]
